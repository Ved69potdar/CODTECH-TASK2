Objective:
The Interactive Command-Line Calculator is developed to provide users with a simple yet robust tool for performing fundamental mathematical calculations. It implements a user-friendly interface that guides users through entering numbers and selecting desired operations while ensuring input validation and error handling. The calculator supports continuous calculations through a loop mechanism that allows users to perform multiple operations in a single session. It features comprehensive error handling to manage invalid inputs and edge cases like division by zero. The program maintains a clear communication flow with users through descriptive prompts and formatted result displays.

Key Activities:

Input processing and validation that safely handles user-provided numbers and operation choices while protecting against invalid inputs through try-except blocks and type conversion.
Implementation of core arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with built-in safeguards against common mathematical errors like division by zero.
Session management through a continuous loop system that allows users to perform multiple calculations and provides a clean exit mechanism when calculations are complete.
Technologies Used:

Python: Primary programming language utilized for implementing arithmetic operations, control flow, and input/output handling with built-in mathematical functionality.
Google Colab: Cloud-based development platform providing an interactive environment for testing and executing Python code with real-time output display.
